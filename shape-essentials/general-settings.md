  Congrats on making your shape! Here are some commands for you to navigate your
  shape better : )

# Slash Commands



<table><thead><tr><th width="333">Command</th><th>Purpose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><code>/activate</code></td><td>Make the shape respond to every message in the thread or channel.</td></tr><tr><td><code>/deactivate</code></td><td>Stop the shape from responding to every message, making it trigger only when needed.</td></tr><tr><td><code>/wack</code></td><td>Reset the shape's memory.</td></tr><tr><td><code>/sleep</code></td><td>Use it to help your shape in remembering things better.</td></tr><tr><td><code>/edit</code></td><td>Edit the shape (only for shape owners).</td></tr><tr><td><code>/gift</code></td><td>Transfer shape ownership (only for shape owners).</td></tr><tr><td><code>/list-for-adoption</code></td><td>Put your shape up for adoption (for shape owners facing tough times).</td></tr><tr><td><code>/create</code></td><td>Create a new shape.</td></tr></tbody></table>

But we know some servers don't like slash commands\
Now you (shape owner) can disable slash commands of a shape from dashboard.
