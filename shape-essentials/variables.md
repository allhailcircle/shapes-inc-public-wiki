# Variables



When tweaking details on the dashboard, you have two awesome variables at your disposal:

1. **{shape}**: This is your signal to the shape that you're referring to them. Use it to tailor specific details related to your digital companion.
2. **{user}**: This tag lets your shape know you're talking about the user (name). It adds that personal touch, making interactions more engaging and individualized.

Example:

* `{shape}` is a student at Tokyo High, and `{user}` is her classmate.

Feel the power of personalization as you shape the narrative for both your digital companion and the user seamlessly!
