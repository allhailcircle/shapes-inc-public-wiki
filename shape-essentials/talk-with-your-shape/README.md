    Note: This will only work if you have a message history with a shape.



## Discord Link

* By default, all Shapes have a default `/link` command. In some cases, you may need to enable it. To enable the command, head on over to the General Settings and enable slash commands. If the toggle is grey, click on it to turn it green and press "Save Changes"&#x20;
