# Adopting a Shape

***

Shapes are available for adoption when they have been in zero servers for 2 days. This also means no one can currently DM them.&#x20;

There are two ways you can adopt a shape. You can either DM Shapesy or you can use the /create command on any shape. This guide will show how to do both. &#x20;

## DMing Shapesy

1. Head over to the [Shapes Inc discord server](https://discord.gg/shapes).&#x20;
2. Click this icon<img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2024-07-01 at 6.38.47 PM.png" alt="" data-size="line">at the top right to view the Member List.&#x20;
3.  Shapesy is the first member listed. Click on Shapesy's profile and send a message.&#x20;

7. Wait a few seconds for Anushk to review your application.
8.  Now you can click Add to Server to add this shape to your server or you can click on [shapes.inc](https://shapes.inc/) to go to the shape's dashboard. You can change/edit any of the shape's settings on the shape's dashboard.&#x20;
