# Shape Developer Program

From making hundreds of shapes a week to getting shapes into thousands of servers, Shapes, Inc. Creators reimagine the possibilities of shapes.

The Shape Developer Program is a program focused on rewarding top Shape Creators for doing what they do best: create. Rewards arenâ€™t just for making the most popular shapes, but for making shapes for others. We will be giving rewards weekly, recognizing qualifying Shape Developers to continue their exceptional work. Itâ€™s our way of supporting the hard work of Shapes, Incâ€™s community of creators.

Reaching this level of success typically requires a lot of time, effort, skill, and strategy. Regardless of goals, be it fun or career advancement, we offer creators what they need to start building for free at [shapes.inc](https://shapes.inc).
