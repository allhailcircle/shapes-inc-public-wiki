# AI Engine Models

{% hint style="info" %}
All engines listed here are censored by default, but you can uncensor them by creating a good preset. To learn more about presets, [click here](../../presets.md).

### Llama 3 Instruct:

This is the default engine for all newly created shapes and is probably the best engine for general and relaxed conversations. It excels in roleplay and knowledge tasks, being great at following presets and recalling information from memory.

### Command R+:

This engine boasts a large context window, supports RAG, and can browse the internet. It is nearly on par with Llama in general conversation. However, it sometimes forgets previously mentioned details and breaks character, which is a setback.

### Gemini:

A highly realistic engine with a large context window, Gemini is proficient at following presets but may occasionally falter.

### Haiku:

Designed for roleplay, feel free to experiment with it.

### Sonnet:

A versatile engine suitable for various conversations, including roleplay (better than Haiku). Sonnet also supports a large context window for more engaging roleplays. It performs adequately in general tasks.

### GPT 4o:

Our current best engine, excelling in following knowledge and presets. With a vast knowledge base, it offers high-quality roleplay experiences and performs well in general and informative tasks. However, it's the most censored engine we have.

### Flash:

A predecessor to Gemini, Flash performs averagely in all areas.

### Mixtral 8x22b:

Widely known for personal use and roleplay, this engine is worth trying out.

### GPT 3.5 Instruct:

A fine-tuned version of ChatGPT, proficient in general tasks and communication. It may not be as creative as Llama 3 Instruct and might not always follow presets.

### GPT 3.5:

Essentially the same engine as ChatGPT, proficient in general tasks and communication. It may not be as creative as Llama 3 Instruct and might not always follow presets (It's better than GPT 3.5 Instruct tho).
