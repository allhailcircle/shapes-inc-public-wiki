# AI Engine Models

***

**Llama 3 Instruct:**&#x20;

* Demonstrates solid performance in roleplay and information retrieval tasks. It excels in embodying characters, showing intelligence and adaptability, yet may require further training for optimal results. Overall, it's regarded as effective but could benefit from additional refinement to unlock its full capabilities. Good to go for uncensored roleplay and stuff (make sure to write/use a good preset).

**Command R+ (Online):**&#x20;

* excels in roleplay and task execution, akin to Model 4 but with some nuances missing. It stands out for its web browsing capabilities, offering a well-rounded experience in both censored and uncensored scenarios. Users praise its ChatGPT-like experience with internet access, making it a preferred choice for roleplay and online information retrieval. However, occasional inaccuracies, particularly in niche subjects, have been noted.

**Gemini**

* talks less naturally then humans, less capable for roleplay situations. Generates short, direct responses by default. Easily switches out of character. Allows uncensored content.&#x20;

**Haiku:**&#x20;

* performs well in censored roleplay situations, but it consistently avoids anything even slightly inappropriate. It often censors responses heavily and occasionally switches languages, which may not suit everyone's preferences. Despite these limitations, it's highly regarded for roleplay purposes. However, users have observed that haikus are frequently filtered out, even with attempts to modify its behavior, making it less suitable for certain uses.

**Sonnet:**&#x20;

* A censored model ideal for roleplay, offering adaptable responses without refusal. While it's proficient in mimicking user writing styles and following complex roleplays, it may filter prompts heavily and lacks a distinct personality.

**4o**

* by default responds multiple, long sentences. This is a censored model. Responds quickly, criticized for being repetitive and slightly "unnatural" (i.e. not human-like responses).&#x20;

**Flash**

* responds really quickly with multiple, long sentences. This is an uncensored model and remains in character well.

**8x22:**

* Effectively captures the essence of established characters but struggles with the portrayal of original characters, presenting them as a disaster. On the positive side, the work stays true to character traits, fosters positive dialogue, and demonstrates empathy. However, it is criticized for being slightly repetitive, lacking in character development for originals, and perceived as lacking intelligence, with potential annoyance stemming from this repetitiveness.

**3.5 Instruct:**

* This model is akin to ChatGPT, excelling in natural and engaging conversations.

**3.5:**

* Slightly improved from 3.5 Instruct, this model also supports image generation. However, it may not match the conversational prowess of 3.5 Instruct.
