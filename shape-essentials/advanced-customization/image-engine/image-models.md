# Image Models

***

**SDXL Turbo (recommended)**

* SDXL maintains intent and content of shorter prompts for generated realistic images. This model allows 'negative prompts' which can significantly help clarify image content. Overall this is the recommended image model to use.&#x20;

**Stable Diffusion 3**

* This model is designed to offer improved quality of text generation in images and create 3D/realistic images. Stable Diffusion 3 is not the best model for anime style images.

**dalle-3**

* In comparison to other image generation models, dalle-3 does not provide as accurate images and requires more detailed prompts. The images generated are often hyper-realistic. This model specializes in generating images similar to artwork. Although dalle-3 isnâ€™t made for anime or drawings, it can create them with detailed prompts.
