# Knowledge

## Links

If your shape has a dedicated wiki page or webpage with comprehensive details, drop the link here. Your shape will scrape information from it, providing users with a wealth of knowledge.

{% hint style="info" %}
Uploading a link is a one-time knowledge update. So, if the website changes, the knowledge wonâ€™t update. If you want the knowledge to update, you will have to re-upload the website link (or type in the new information).&#x20;
{% endhint %}

## General

This is your canvas for unlimited general information about your shape. From its origin story to its quirks, share everything that {user} (the person wanting to talk to your shape) might find interesting.

## No-Code Commands

Configure custom commands to enhance the interaction with your shape. Here are a few examples:&#x20;

**Examples:**

* `If someone types !server then {shape} responds that the user should join the server at discord.gg/circlelabs`
* `(shape} is a bot that is only about sending country flag images to people Like if someone asks for a flag then the bot sends [<country name here>](`[`https://www.countryflags.com/wp-content/uploads/`](https://www.countryflags.com/wp-content/uploads/)`<country name here in lowercase and no space>-flag-png-large.png) Like if someone asks for Germany flag then the bot sends` [`Germany`](https://www.countryflags.com/wp-content/uploads/germany-flag-png-large.png)&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Your shape won't repeat the commands word-for-word -- they'll make something similar in their own voice!
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Use unique command names. This will make sure they register! For example, !hi might not register with your Shape but !Nickicord will work.
{% endhint %}

## Relationships

Dive into the social aspect of your shape. Use mentions/tags to add relationships for your shape.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
You can only tag users who have talked to shapes. Tags are Discord usernames.&#x20;
{% endhint %}
