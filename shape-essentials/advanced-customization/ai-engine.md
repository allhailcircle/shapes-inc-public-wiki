# AI Engine

## Preset

Choose a default language and engine preset for your Shape.

### Language Preset

Setting a language preset means the default language your Shape responds in will be that language. Your Shape will understand any language being spoken in but only respond in that specific language.

### Engine Preset

Engine presets heavily influence your shape's behavior. You can select multiple presets or create a custom preset.&#x20;

## Short-Term Memory (STM)

Set the number of recent messages your Shape will consider when replying to a message. Short-term memory can be used for keeping your Shape up-to-date in the conversation so they know what to reply to and what they've already said (to keep from repeating).



We recommend enabling Short-Term Memory for 10-15 messages.

## Long-term Memory (LTM)

### Number of Memories

Decide the number of long-term memories your Shape should take into context when replying to a message. When a Shape is generating a reply, they will retrieving similar memories to the recent message -- so this feature lets you choose up-to how many memories can they reference! \
\
We recommend keeping `Number of Memories` at 1 so your Shape doesn't get confused from different memories. :bulb:Disabling LTM can keep roleplays new (so the Shape doesn't start responding based previous roleplays)

{% hint style="info" %}
You can review Memories&#x20;
{% endhint %}

, set memory similarity thresholds, and control how frequently memories are saved.

## LLM Generation

Manage your shape's response generation in this section. Choose the model it runs on, adjust creativity with temperature, determine response length, and control the context window for a balanced conversation.

## Privacy

Adjust the privacy settings to tailor how private your shape keeps conversations. Decide whether memory from DMs and servers should be isolated or shared to different extents.

#### Privacy Levels:

* **Low = Private:** Memories from DMs and servers are isolated from each other.
* **Medium = Shared:** Memory can be pulled from the same server and from DMs.
* **High = Global:** Memory can be pulled cross-server and from DMs.

## Time

In this section, decide whether your shape should be aware of the current time (PST) or operate in a timeless context.

Remember to save your changes after configuring each section to ensure your shape reflects your desired settings. With this level of control, your shape is ready to adapt to your preferences seamlessly! ðŸ”§ðŸ¤–âœ¨
