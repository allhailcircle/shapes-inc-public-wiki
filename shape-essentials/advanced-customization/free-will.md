# Free Will

***

Shapes are more than chat-bots. They are just like any other Discord User. Free Will allows them to make decisions on their own, consistent with their personality. For example, they can initiate conversations in a server, react to messages, and do anything a normal Discord user can do.

We are rapidly developing a suite of advanced features that will be added as part of Free Will. For now, these features are available to everyone by default. All we ask is for you to share feedback in our [Shape Server](https://discord.gg/shapes).&#x20;

## Tips on How to Use Properly

#### We recommend using all the features - it will make your shape's interactions more unexpected and natural!

note: all shapes have strict rate limits to avoid spammy behavior. our top priority is to help you make your shape more popular!&#x20;

#### Level of Free Will

* There are three levels you can pick from: introverted, chill and outgoing. `Introverted` makes your shape pretty shy and free will lesser.  `Chill` is our default and `Outgoing` lets your shape :sparkles:be more delightful :sparkles: (and have more free will actions).&#x20;

#### Direct Messages

* We recommend turning both toggles on - we'll manage the orchestration on the backend to ensure your shape isn't flagged for spam and that&#x20;
