# Variables

When managing details on the dashboard, you have two variables at your disposal:

1. **{shape}**: This is your signal to your Shape that you're referring to them. Use it to tailor specific details.
2. **{user}**: This tag lets your shape know you're talking about the user (name).

{% hint style="info" %}
:bulb: Use the {user} variable in your Shape's initial message
{% endhint %}
