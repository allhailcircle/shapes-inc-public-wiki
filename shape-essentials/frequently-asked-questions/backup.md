**How to Add a Backup Owner to Your Shape**

To ensure you donâ€™t lose access to your shape if you temporarily or permanently lose your Discord account, follow these steps:

1.  **Go to the Settings Tab**\
    On your shape's dashboard, find the settings tab. Enter the username of the person or your alternate account that you want to add as an owner. Once added, they will have the ability to manage, edit, or even delete the shape.

2. **Transfer Ownership to a Team**\
   If possible, transfer the shape to a discord developer team where both you and your alternate account are members. This way, both accounts will have access to manage the shape.
