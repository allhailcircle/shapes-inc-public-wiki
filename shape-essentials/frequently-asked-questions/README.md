# Frequently Asked Questions

## OAuth2 Code Grant

Inviting your bot is usually quite easy, although sometimes you may receive an error regarding "Bot requires a code grant." This is due to the "Requires OAuth2 Code Grant" setting enabled. You can fix this by doing the following:

1. Go to the [<mark style="color:purple;">**Discord Developer portal**</mark>](https://discord.com/developers) and select your bot's application.
2. Under your bot's application, go to the **Bots** tab.
3. Under the **Bots** tab, look underneath **Authorization Flow** and locate **REQUIRES OAUTH2 CODE GRANT**.
4. Disable **OAUTH2 CODE GRANT**.&#x20;
5. Retry inviting your Discord bot.
