# Disabling a Shape

***

Disabling your shape means turning off all messaging capabilities for your shape in ALL discord servers. \
\
To do so, head over to our [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/shapes) and make a post in [#shape-help channel](https://discord.com/channels/781212328749301790/1185774428546682881).

Please submit the [shapes.inc](https://shapes.inc/) link of your shape, explain that you want to disable the shape and ping a shapes.inc staff.
