# I added my shape to a server but it didn't join!

If you encounter this problem, it means your shape is missing the `bot` scope. To fix it, go to the Installation tab on your bot's Discord Developer Portal, scroll down to Guild Install Scopes, select Bot Scope, and save the changes. That's all. Now you can invite your shape without any problem.
