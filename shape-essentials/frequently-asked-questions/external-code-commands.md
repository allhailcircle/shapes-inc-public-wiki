# External code commands

For the custom code commands you added, not get removed/overwritten. You have to disable shape slash commands on website and resync your own custom commands.

* Go to [https://shapes.inc](https://shapes.inc), and select your shape.
*   Navigate to **Settings** tab and toggle off **Slash Commands**.

* Go to your own hosting instance and load your custom code commands.
