# My shape doesn't have slash commands even in DMs!

If your shape doesn't have any slash commands even though the options below is enabled. Here are 3 ways on how you re-enable it again.

## Solution 1

**Go to your Shape's dashboard** and navigate to the **Settings** tab.&#x20;

**Disable** the "Enable Shape Slash Commands" option and save the changes. **Re-enable** the "Enable Shape Slash Commands" and save the changes again. Then, restart Discord.

## Solution 2

Try resetting your shape's token by going to **Settings**, scroll down, click on **Danger Zone**, and pressing on **"Reset Shape's Discord Bot Token"**.

Then go to [**Discord's Developer Portal**](https://discord.com/developers/applications/), click on your shape, Bot > Reset Token, and copy the token and paste it. This should restart your shape and hopefully have slash commands re-enabled.

## Solution 3

If the two solutions provided don't work, then join our [**official Discord server**](https://discord.gg/shapes) and make a post in **#shape-help channel**. From there, ping a shapes.inc staff. We will help you restart your shape and your shape's slash commands should come back.

## How do I prevent this from happening?

Try to be careful when changing these options in Settings if you plan on doing so. If you didn't touch any, then this issue is very rare.
