# My shape is talking in every channel, how can i stop it? / freewill interference solution

If your shape is talking in channels where it shouldn't, it's acting on its [free will](../introducing-free-will.md). But don't worry, there's a fix for this! First, you might wonder if you can disable your shape's free will entirely. The answer is yes, but you need to have at least one shape with free will enabled on your server. If you disable it for all shapes, one of them will automatically reactivate its free will.

#### How to Stop Your Shape from Interacting in Unwanted Channels

**Disable its freewill:**

* &#x20;Use your shape's `/freewill` command and toggle it `off`.

You are required to have at least one shape with active freewill in your server.
{% endhint %}

**Use Blacklist / whitelist feature:**

* Open your shape's dashboard using the `/dashboard` command.
* Scroll down to the server section and click on the "Server Settings" tab.
* Select your server and wait for the configurations to load. (If your server doesn't appear, log out and back in, then try again.)
* Once loaded, you'll see the server-level configurations for your shape.

You can choose to either **blacklist** or **whitelist** channels:

* **Blacklist**: Your shape won’t talk in these channels.
* **Whitelist**: Your shape will only interact in these channels.

**Important:** Use only one option—blacklist or whitelist. Using both can cause bugs and might make your shape continue interacting in unwanted channels.\
