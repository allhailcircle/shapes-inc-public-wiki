# Models



**Llama 3 Instruct:**&#x20;

* demonstrates solid performance in roleplay and information retrieval tasks. It excels in embodying characters, showing intelligence and adaptability, yet may require further training for optimal results. Overall, it's regarded as effective but could benefit from additional refinement to unlock its full capabilities.

**Command R+ (Online):**&#x20;

* excels in roleplay and task execution, akin to Model 4 but with some nuances missing. It stands out for its web browsing capabilities, offering a well-rounded experience in both censored and uncensored scenarios. Users praise its ChatGPT-like experience with internet access, making it a preferred choice for roleplay and online information retrieval. However, occasional inaccuracies, particularly in niche subjects, have been noted.

**Haiku:**&#x20;

* performs well in censored roleplay situations, but it consistently avoids anything even slightly inappropriate. It often censors responses heavily and occasionally switches languages, which may not suit everyone's preferences. Despite these limitations, it's highly regarded for roleplay purposes. However, users have observed that haikus are frequently filtered out, even with attempts to modify its behavior, making it less suitable for certain uses.

**Sonnet:**&#x20;

* an uncensored model ideal for roleplay, offering adaptable responses without refusal. While it's proficient in mimicking user writing styles and following complex roleplays, it may filter prompts heavily and lacks a distinct personality.

**Opus:**&#x20;

* the wildest and most uncensored model with high intelligence and strong ethical guidelines. While excellent for complex tasks and information gathering, its heavy censorship may limit roleplay suitability. Opus has potential but tends to send long messages and can resist convention when challenged.

**8x22:**

* effectively captures the essence of established characters but struggles with the portrayal of original characters, presenting them as a disaster. On the positive side, the work stays true to character traits, fosters positive dialogue, and demonstrates empathy. However, it is criticized for being slightly repetitive, lacking in character development for originals, and perceived as lacking intelligence, with potential annoyance stemming from this repetitiveness.

**3.5 Instruct:**

* This model is akin to ChatGPT, excelling in natural and engaging conversations.

**3.5:**

* Slightly improved from 3.5 Instruct, this model also supports image generation. However, it may not match the conversational prowess of 3.5 Instruct.

**4:**

* The superior choice, excelling across various tasks. Whether it's conversation or other functions, this model is well-rounded. Note that these models are lightly censored and moderated.
