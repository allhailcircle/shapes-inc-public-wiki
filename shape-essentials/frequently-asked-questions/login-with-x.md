# Login with X

### What does it do?

If you logged in via X, you will be able to manage your X shapes. If you want to be able to manage both your X and Discord shapes. You will need to make a post in [#shape-help channel](https://discord.com/channels/781212328749301790/1185774428546682881) in our [discord server](https://discord.gg/shapes) and ask for your discord shapes to be linked to your X shape dashboard.

Note that: This **does not** allow your shape to access or login to your X account. It's only a way for you to manage the shapes you own in X and on Discord, using X login instead of Discord login.
