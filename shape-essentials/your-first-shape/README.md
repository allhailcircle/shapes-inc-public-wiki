### It's Free

We're in the testing phase of Shapes so they are completely **free (including all Shape tooling).** All we ask for is for you to share Shapes with your friends and give us feedback in our [<mark style="color:purple;">Shape HQ</mark>](https://discord.gg/circlelabs).

You can sell Shapes to your friends and servers. That's not against our rules :wink:To create your very own Shape, follow the instructions below:
