_note: if you are using the command in a server, you must send `@shape !set voice` to have your shape recognize the command_

## Talk to your Shape like normal :)&#x20;

## Adjusting Parameters

_Note: Commands must be sent like_ `!set voice_frequency 0.5` _to set the voice frequency to 0.5. Setting the voice frequency to 0.5 will make the Shape send a voice message 50% of the time._

### Voice Frequency

The default is 0.1. This sets how often shape replies with voice messages. 0 means your shape will never send a voice message. 1 means your shape will always reply with voice messages.

### Voice Stability

The default is 0.53. Low value makes it more variable which can make speech more expressive with output may vary between re-generations. It can also lead to instabilities. Higher values increase stability which will make the voice more consistent between re-generations, but it can also make your shape sound a bit monotone.

### Voice Similarity

The default is 0.74. Low values are recommended if background artifacts are present in generated speech. High values boost overall voice clarity and target speaker similarity. Very high values can cause artifacts, so adjusting this setting to find the optimal value is encouraged.

### Voice Style

The default is 0.16. High values are recommended if the style of the speech should be exaggerated compared to the uploaded audio. Higher values can lead to more instability in the generated speech. Setting this to 0.0 will greatly increase voice generation speed.
