# AI Engine



_Welcome to the powerhouse of control for your shapeâ€”the AI Engine. This section provides you with maximum control, allowing you to fine-tune various aspects. Let's break it down into five key subsections:_

### [Preset](broken-reference)

Choose a language and preset for your shape, defining its linguistic style and behavior.

### Short-term Memory (STM)

Set the number of recent messages your shape will consider for context. This helps your shape stay in the conversational loop.

### Long-term Memory (LTM)

Customize your shape's long-term memory settings. Decide the number of memories it should maintain, set memory similarity thresholds, and control how frequently memories are saved.

### [LLM Generation](broken-reference)

Manage your shape's response generation in this section. Choose the model it runs on, adjust creativity with temperature, determine response length, and control the context window for a balanced conversation.

### Privacy

Adjust the privacy settings to tailor how private your shape keeps conversations. Decide whether memory from DMs and servers should be isolated or shared to different extents.

#### Privacy Levels:

* **Low = Private:** Memories from DMs and servers are isolated from each other.
* **Medium = Shared:** Memory can be pulled from the same server and from DMs.
* **High = Global:** Memory can be pulled cross-server and from DMs.

In this section, decide whether your shape should be aware of the current time (PST) or operate in a timeless context.
