### **Language Preset**

The **Language Preset** allows you to choose the default language for your Shape. This is the language that your Shape will use when responding to users.



You can choose from a variety of languages, including English, Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean. If you want your Shape to be able to communicate with users from all over the world, then you should choose a language that is widely spoken, such as English.

### Engine Preset

The **Engine Preset** allows you to choose a pre-configured set of parameters for your Shape's AI Engine. These parameters determine the overall behavior of your Shape, including its personality, tone, and level of creativity.



The best preset for your Shape will depend on the specific needs of your Shape. You can even add multiple presets to your Shape.&#x20;



There are a variety of engine presets available, each with its own unique characteristics. There are 3 categories within Engine Presets:

* Featured
* User-Made
* Experimental

All 3 types of Engine Presets work well with shapes. The main difference in these presets are the parameters / taste.
