(i) Personal Information. This is information that directly or indirectly identifies you, such as your name, email address, credit card information, or other identifying information about you, or information that would, when combined with other information you provide or that is broadly available, be likely to identify you.

We may link together different types of Other Information or link Other Information to Personal Information.

(b) You may interact with Circle Labs in ways that require Circle Labs to gather Personal Information. The amount and type of information that Circle Labs gathers depends on the nature of your interaction with the Services (and the Resources provided therein).

They tell us which parts of the Resources you’ve visited so Circle Labs can alert you to software compatibility issues and save your preferences for future visits to the Resources. Web beacons and pixel tags are images embedded in a webpage or e-mail for the purpose of measuring and analyzing usage and activity. Our Services (or third party service providers acting on our behalf) may use web beacons and pixel tags to help us analyze usage and improve our functionality.

Circle Labs visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Resources; provided, however, that Circle Labs disclaims, and you hereby waive, any claim or liability that may arise due to your partial or incomplete access to the content of any of the Resources as a result thereof.
