This Privacy Policy explains Circle Labs’ collection and use of information that may identify you and covers information collected through the Services and/or Resources.&#x20;

It is Circle Labs’ policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect, subject to the terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and the Terms and Conditions for the Services, as either or both may be amended from time to time.&#x20;

* ## TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT

#### (a)            We collect the following information about you:

**(i)              Personal Information. This is information that directly or indirectly identifies you, such as your name, email address, credit card information, or other identifying information about you, or information that would, when combined with other information you provide or that is broadly available, be likely to identify you.**

**(ii)            Other Information**_**.**_** Other Information is information that is not Personal Information. Other Information does not, by itself, individually identify you, such as browser type, operating system, technical data, and usage. We may link together different types of Other Information or link Other Information to Personal Information.**

#### (b)            You may interact with Circle Labs in ways that require Circle Labs to gather Personal Information. The amount and type of information that Circle Labs gathers depends on the nature of your interaction with the Services (and the Resources provided therein). For example, when you sign up for an account with Circle Labs, we will ask you to provide your name and email address.  Circle Labs collects only such information as is legal and appropriate.  We also collect and store all chats and conversations entered through the Services for product improvement and safety compliance purposes in a human readable format.&#x20;

#### (c)             You may choose not to supply Personal Information, however, your choice not to provide information may prevent you from using certain Resources or engaging in certain activities on the Services.

#### (d)            Like most website and application operators, Circle Labs collects Other Information of the sort that web browsers, applications and servers typically make available to operators, like the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Circle Labs may use this information for various purposes including, for example, to better understand how visitors to the Services use the Circle Labs’ Resources. The purposes for collecting and using this data may change from time to time at Circle Labs’ discretion, and Circle Labs may release Other Information in the aggregate. By utilizing any of the Resources, you agree to such use.&#x20;

## SECTION 4. COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES

#### (a) In addition, some of our Services may utilize “cookies” and other tracking technologies like pixel tags and web beacons (often called “smart cookies”) to improve the functionality of the Services. Cookies are text files that are sent by servers to web browsers and stored on your computer. They tell us which parts of the Resources you’ve visited so Circle Labs can alert you to software compatibility issues and save your preferences for future visits to the Resources. Web beacons and pixel tags are images embedded in a webpage or e-mail for the purpose of measuring and analyzing usage and activity. Our Services (or third party service providers acting on our behalf) may use web beacons and pixel tags to help us analyze usage and improve our functionality. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Information previously provided by you.

#### (b) We may use information collected from cookies and other technologies to improve your user experience and the overall quality of our services. We use cookies to help us identify and track visitors, their usage of the Resources, and their access preferences. We may use your Personal Information to track which Resources you visit, which website or resources you visited before coming to our Website, and where you go after you leave our Website. We can then develop statistics that help us understand how our visitors use our Websites and how to improve our Website. Circle Labs visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using the Resources; provided, however, that Circle Labs disclaims, and you hereby waive, any claim or liability that may arise due to your partial or incomplete access to the content of any of the Resources as a result thereof.

#### (c) We also may use cookies provided by Google Analytics or other third parties to help us measure how visitors use the Services. The information collected is used for a variety of purposes, including, but not limited to, site traffic reporting, unique visitor counts, and content optimization.
