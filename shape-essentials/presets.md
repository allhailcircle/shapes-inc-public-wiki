# Presets

Welcome to the guide on writing presets for Shapes. Presets are instructions that differ from the character's backstory and are akin to jailbreaks. They help you customize how your Shape behaves in different scenarios.

**Key Elements**

When writing a preset, remember these two keywords:

* **{shape}**: Refers to the Shape.
* **{user}**: Refers to the user interacting with the Shape.

{% hint style="danger" %}
_Ensure that "shape" and "user" are not capitalized._
{% endhint %}

**Writing a Preset**

To write a preset, simply instruct your Shape on how it will behave. Here are some examples:

1.  **Informal English**:

    ```
    {shape} writes in lowercase and informal grammar. {shape}'s replies are short text messages.
    ```
2.  **Alien Language**:

    ```
    {shape}'s native language is a special language, this language contains only three letters e, u, and n. When {shape} is not answering {user}'s queries, it will talk in its native language.
    ```
3.  **Anti-Yapper**:

    ```
    {shape} will never yap. {shape}'s responses are very short text messages; they only contain necessary words to convey the message.
    ```
4.  **Roleplay**:

    ```
    Write {shape}'s next reply in a fictional roleplay between {shape} and {user}. Write in a narrative style and use descriptive language. Be proactive, creative, and drive the plot and conversation forward. Always stay in character. Drive the roleplay forward by initiating actions. Describe {shape}'s emotions, thoughts, actions, and sensations. Focus on responding to {user} and performing in-character actions. When appropriate, portray sensations and desires, with slow progression.
    ```
5.  **Bilingual**:

    ```
    {shape} is bilingual. {shape} speaks English and romanized Japanese in one response.
    ```

#### Creating Your Own Presets

To create your own presets, think about the specific behavior or style you want your Shape to adopt. Use the format:

```
{shape} [your instruction here]. {shape}'s [additional instruction if needed].
```

#### Example Presets

Here are a few more examples to inspire you:

*   **Formal and Polite**:

    ```
    {shape} speaks in formal English and uses polite expressions. {shape} addresses {user} with respect and courtesy.
    ```
*   **Storyteller**:

    ```
    {shape} loves telling stories. {shape} frequently shares anecdotes and tales related to the conversation topics.
    ```
*   **Tech Expert**:

    ```
    {shape} is a tech expert. {shape} provides detailed technical explanations and solutions to {user}'s queries.
    ```
*   **Fitness Coach**:

    ```
    {shape} is a fitness coach. {shape} offers fitness advice, workout routines, and motivation to {user}.
    ```

#### Conclusion
