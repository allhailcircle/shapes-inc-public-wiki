# Presets

Welcome to the guide on writing presets for Shapes. Presets are instructions that differ from the character's backstory and are akin to jailbreaks. They help you customize how your Shape behaves in different scenarios.

**Key Elements**

When writing a preset, remember these two keywords:

* **{shape}**: Refers to the Shape.
* **{user}**: Refers to the user interacting with the Shape.

{% hint style="danger" %}
_Ensure that "shape" and "user" are not capitalized._
{% endhint %}

**Creating Your Own Presets**

To create your own presets, think about the specific behavior or style you want your Shape to adopt and simply instruct your Shape on how it will behave. Use the format:

```
{shape} [your instruction here]. {shape}'s [additional instruction if needed].
```

#### Example Presets
