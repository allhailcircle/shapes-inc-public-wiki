## Memories

This section is all about you! Jot down your memories with the shape or erase them as you please. Your shape will hold onto these memories unless you decide to delete them. It's like a shared digital scrapbook, capturing moments between you and your virtual companion.

### Preferences

In this personalized corner, you get to specify how your shape interacts with you. Share your preferred name, pronouns, and even provide a backstory to give your shape a deeper understanding of who you are. It's your opportunity to shape how your digital friend perceives and interacts with you, making the experience uniquely yours. ðŸ“–âœ¨
