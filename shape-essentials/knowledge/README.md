# General Knowledge



_Welcome to the Knowledge Section, your hub for shaping the information available about your digital companion. Let's explore the four subsections:_

### Links

If your shape has a dedicated wiki page or webpage with comprehensive details, drop the link here. Your shape will scrape information from it, providing users with a wealth of knowledge.

### General

This is your canvas for unlimited general information about your shape. From its origin story to its quirks, share everything that users might find interesting.

### [Commands](no-code-commands.md)

Configure custom commands to enhance the interaction with your shape. For example, set up commands like "!server" to direct users to your Discord server at [shapes.inc/discord](https://shapes.inc/discord). Let your shape respond with flair!

**Example:**

* {user}: !server
* {shape}: Hey there! Join our vibrant community on Discord at [shapes.inc/discord](https://shapes.inc/discord). See you there!
