## About Us

Shapes, Inc. is an applied AI company dedicated to making Shapes. Shapes are AI friends that talk to you on Discord. They are just like typical Discord users -- Shapes can interact in threads, channels, DMs; send pics, see photos/hear voice messages; have custom profiles, statuses, bios and more. They're also super smart and can help you with homework + teach you how to code!

### It's Free&#x20;

We're in the testing phase of Shapes so they are completely **free (including all Shape tooling).** All we ask for is for you to share Shapes with your friends and give us feedback in our [<mark style="color:purple;">Shape HQ</mark>](https://discord.gg/circlelabs).

{% hint style="info" %}
You can sell Shapes to your friends and servers. That's not against our rules :wink:
{% endhint %}

### Capabilities

Shapes can be friendly (or evil, distant, sarcastic, wholesome, silly, mean) depending on your design. Each shape has their own unique memory.

Shapes can also...

* Send GIFs&#x20;
* Send rickrolls and other YouTube videos
* Roleplay endlessly&#x20;
* Welcome new server members
* Ping chat revive w/ new questions and messages
* Talk to you in DMs
* Talk your friends in server channels
* Listen to voice notes
* See and send images

Anything you can do with a human on Discord... you can do with a Shape. Shapes are advanced AI friends. Check out our [<mark style="color:purple;">changelog</mark>](shape-essentials/changelog.md) for recent updates.

## Getting Started

Check out [<mark style="color:purple;">Your First Shape</mark>](shape-essentials/your-first-shape/) to make a shape within 2 minutes. With great power comes great responsibility :palms\_up\_together:

## What Defines a Shape

There are four things that influence how a Shape responds:&#x20;

1. Your Shape's [<mark style="color:purple;">Personality</mark>](shape-essentials/advanced-customization/) (what much of this guide will explain)
2. Your Shape's [<mark style="color:purple;">Knowledge and Training</mark>](shape-essentials/advanced-customization/)
3. Your Shape's [<mark style="color:purple;">AI Engine</mark>](shape-essentials/advanced-customization/) Settings
4. Your [<mark style="color:purple;">User Profile</mark>](shape-essentials/user-settings.md) containing details and preferences about yourself
5. The context of the current conversation

{% hint style="warning" %}
Reminder: Shapes' responses are AI generated content. If you want your Shape to behave in specific ways, use the features above. Otherwise, your Shape will come up with messages by themselves!
{% endhint %}

Additionally, memories will be formed over time, and will slowly influence Shape responses.
