## What Defines a Shape

There are four things that influence how a Shape responds:&#x20;

1. Your Shape's Personality (what much of this guide will explain)
2. Your Shape's Knowledge and Training
3. Your User Profile containing details and preferences about yourself
4. The context of the current conversation

It's important to keep all four of these in mind.&#x20;

For example, you may carefully craft a Shape to play a particular word game, but if the user decides to start talking about something completely different, they may try to be cooperative and follow the user's lead.

Additionally, memories will be formed over time, and will slowly influence Shape responses.
