## Getting Started

We support two different developer experiences. Our [**Quick** mode](broken-reference) allows creators to able to create interesting Characters in less than a minute. Our [**Advanced** mode](broken-reference) allows adventurous creators to perfect their Character by using more powerful tools.

### What Defines a Shape

There are four things that influence how a Shape responds:&#x20;

1. The [Character Attributes](broken-reference) (what much of this guide will explain)
2. The [Character Training](broken-reference) from conversations (e.g. star ratings)
3. The [Personas](broken-reference) set by a user containing descriptive details and preferences
4. The context of the current conversation

It's important to keep all four of these in mind.&#x20;

For example, you may carefully craft a Character to play a particular word game, but if the user decides to start talking about something completely different, it may try to be cooperative and follow their lead.

Additionally, user feedback will happen over time, and will slowly influence Character responses.
